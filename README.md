# C-Programming---Assessment 1

These are projects I created for the first assignment for my class in college.
The first, titled "About Me", contains information about myself that will be
outputted when ran.

The second project, titled "U1A1 Commenting", helped my understanding of declaring 
variables and how to code them to output them to the screen. It also helped with
my understanding the importance of comments in code.

The third project, titled "u1a1 Part 3", helped me to distinguish the difference
between int and float. 

The fourth project, titled "u1a1 Part 4", helped me to understand how to prompt 
the user to enter a character or number, save it to a variable, and then output 
the variable.
